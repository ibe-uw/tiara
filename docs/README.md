# Tiara

Deep-learning-based approach for identification of eukaryotic sequences in the metagenomic data powered by PyTorch.  

The sequences are classified in two stages:

- In the first stage, the sequences are classified to classes 
      archaea, bacteria, prokarya, eukarya, organelle and unknown.
- In the second stage, the sequences labeled as organelle in the first stage 
      are classified to either mitochondria, plastid or unknown.

### Name

In the Polish translation of the Harry Potter book series, the Sorting Hat
(which assigned wizards to different houses) was called *Tiara Przydzia≈Çu*.
We thought that it's an appropriate name for a software which classifies 
sequences to different taxonomic units. In English the word *tiara* usually 
refers to a papal tiara. A papal tiara has three crowns, and life has three domains,
so maybe that's another explanation for the name of our program.
